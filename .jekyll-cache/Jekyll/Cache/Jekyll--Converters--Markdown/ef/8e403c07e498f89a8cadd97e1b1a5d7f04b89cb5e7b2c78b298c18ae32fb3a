<p>Beautiful brown liquid steaming in my cup,</p>

<p>Becoming a muddy river as I stir in the cream.</p>

<p>The aroma that gives me courage,</p>

<p>The flavor that tastes like hope for a better day,</p>

<p>And the energy that renews my will to live.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning weâ€™ll do it all again my friend.</p>

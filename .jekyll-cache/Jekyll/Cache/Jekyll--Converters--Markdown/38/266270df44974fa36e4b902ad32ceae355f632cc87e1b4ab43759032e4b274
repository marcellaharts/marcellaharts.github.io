I"<p>Am I good enough?</p>

<p>I’m not really sure.</p>

<p>In fact, I’m sure I’m probably not.</p>

<p>What made me think I could write this poem?</p>

<p>Everyone will laugh at it when they read it,</p>

<p>Or worse, they will be silent and hold their criticism in.</p>

<p>Or worse yet, they’ll say exactly what they think and I’ll be crushed.</p>

<p>Or worst of all, they’ll tell me it’s great but not mean it.</p>

<p>And even if they truly love it, I’ll still wonder if it’s good enough</p>

<p>After the Sea-Ship-after the whistling winds;</p>

<p>After the white-gray sails, taut to their spars and ropes,</p>

<p>Below, a myriad, myriad waves, hastening, lifting up their necks,</p>

<p>Tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship:</p>

<p>Waves of the ocean, bubbling and gurgling, blithely prying,</p>

<p>Waves, undulating waves-liquid, uneven, emulous waves,</p>

<p>Toward that whirling current, laughing and buoyant, with curves,</p>

<p>Where the great Vessel, sailing and tacking, displaced the surface;</p>

I"<p>Nervously I stood there under the porch light</p>

<p>As you smiled at me and moved in closer.</p>

<p>You took me in your arms, and my heart began to thud so loudly</p>

<p>I was sure you could hear it but were pretending you didnâ€™t.</p>

<p>You moistened your lips, looked deeply into my eyes,</p>

<p>And then gently pressed your lips to mine.</p>

<p>A momentâ€™s pause, and you touched my lips with yours again,</p>

<p>A whisper of a kiss that promised more to come.</p>

<p>We kissed again, and during that kiss I felt like I had finally come home.</p>

<p>Looking back, I know I was right as we kiss goodnight and I turn out the light.</p>

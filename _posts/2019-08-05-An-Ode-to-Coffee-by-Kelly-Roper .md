### "An Ode to Coffee" by Kelly Roper

Beautiful brown liquid steaming in my cup,

Becoming a muddy river as I stir in the cream.

The aroma that gives me courage,

The flavor that tastes like hope for a better day,

And the energy that renews my will to live.

Tomorrow morning we'll do it all again my friend.

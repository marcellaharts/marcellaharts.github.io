### "Loves Crimson" by Sheba Marcelah

Listen to my heart,

I am broken down by hurt,

You have torn me apart,

Now here we part.


All I wanted was honesty,

But you spit on my trust,

Like you walked past a sty,

What do I have to say?

Maybe it's better off this way.

If you are reading this am dead,

or lying in a pool of red,

for a while now my heart has bled,

locked my emotions in a vault bolted.


Never thought you would let me down,

Never thought my excistence would by wind be blown,

This time I got worn and you won,

and now you will grace my parade in a black gown.

### "Freshly Old Love" 

We have watched our years pass us and wade,

Yet we still hold more love than the blood running through our veins,

Even as our eyes age and visions fade,

Our memories so many they could shatter our brains,

We have our hearts in sync with beats aligned and our thoughts enlightened,

Let us always give in to each others rythm with ease,

As the clouds give into the breeze,

Tonight as I lay in your frail arms to rest,

May we treasure each breath for it may be our last,

I cuddle close as the sheets feel cold as ice,

Both our dreams locked behind shut eyes,

Hold me in your embrace,

For there I will find my happy place,

Your love so jelly makes ours sound so stale,

But we write on the narrative of our freshly old love tale.

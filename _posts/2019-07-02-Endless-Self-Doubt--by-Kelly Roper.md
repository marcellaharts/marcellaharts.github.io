Am I good enough?

I'm not really sure.

In fact, I'm sure I'm probably not.

What made me think I could write this poem?

Everyone will laugh at it when they read it,

Or worse, they will be silent and hold their criticism in.

Or worse yet, they'll say exactly what they think and I'll be crushed.

Or worst of all, they'll tell me it's great but not mean it.

And even if they truly love it, I'll still wonder if it's good enough
